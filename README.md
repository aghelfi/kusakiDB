# KusakiDB

A novel approach for assessing the existence and completeness of orthogroups in plant species

Orthogroup Definition
---------------------
OGs are defined as descendants from a single gene of the last common ancestor of Viridiplantae.

Description
-----------

KusakiDB is a database of protein orthogroups (OGs) that: </br> 
-- Correlates the information of three important databases, OrthoDB, UniProt and RefSeq; </br>
-- Introduces a new parameter called “Evidence existence,” which is based on the physical existence of at least one protein (or transcript) in each OG; </br>
-- Provides two new tools, known as "OG assessment" and "OG management", that compare OGs at a family level within 117 plant species or with user's data; </br>

Availability
------------
KusakiDB is available [on-line](http://pgdbjsnp.kazusa.or.jp).<br/>

Docker Container
