# KusakiDB

A novel approach for validation and enrichment of protein orthologous groups 

Description
-----------

KusakiDB is a database of protein orthologous groups (OGs) that: </br> 
-- Provides an assessment and management tool for comparison of OGs at a family level in 117 plant species with whole genomes; </br>
-- Correlates the information of three important databases, OrthoDB, UniProt and RefSeq, which increases the number of species; </br>
-- Introduces a validation tag that is based on the existence of at least one protein (or transcript) in each OG.</br>

Availability
------------
KusakiDB is available [on-line](http://pgdbjsnp.kazusa.or.jp).<br/>
